# DataScience16CTW - Political/Social Justice Tweet Visualization
A project done as part of Olin College of Engineering's Data Science Course, 2016
Students: Sophia Seitz and Victoria Preston
Instructor: Paul Ruvolo

## Project Goals
Using data from the Twitter API, we would like to visualize how during political or social justice events information propogates through the Twitter network. In particular, we would like to look at: who is engaging, how many are engaging, how certain hashtags gain momentum (virality), and where conversations tend to happen on certain topics. Our minimum viable product will be a series of static visualizations of these questions with an intended reach goal of building an interactive visualizer. Overall, we want to inform people looking at our project on how information spreads, and perhaps discuss the implications of this knowledge.

## Changing the World through Social Media
With the advent of Twitter and other social media platforms, the ability for people to get informed and engage in social justice or political movements is more easily accessible (lower activation energy) - something that was not as easy only 10 years ago. We would like to visualize information spread in this way to have a formative discussion on the use of social media as a platform for justice and awareness which could have serious impacts on small local communities to larger politics. 

## Project Development
Initially, we will explore the dataset, familiarizing ourselves with the data objects and engage in exploration. Further, we will incrementally add complexity to this exploration in order to develop interesting visual insights on the data. We will start with Python as our visualizer then, time allowing, potentially move to Javscript/D3 visualizations. By mid-project we will be familiar with our dataset and have a firm picture on what visualizations we will want to create with it sketched out or roughly prototyped. All of our development plans currently hinge on the ability to get data from Twitter on Ferguson, with a back-up plan being getting data about the recent GOP Debate.

## Assessing this Project
We wish to be assessed in the ease of use (given interactive visualizations) of our project, in addition to the clarity of the story (is there a coherent story or message being presented), clarity of data presentation (are all figures legible, accessible, and appropriately labeled), and documentation/style of our code. In particular, our learning goals for this project tend towards exploring how to make good visualizations/figures of merit, and so wish to be assessed more critically on these. Our standard is: would someone who is non-technical be able to use our product effectively and understand the story; for someone who is technical, would they be able to re-create our work from our documentation.
